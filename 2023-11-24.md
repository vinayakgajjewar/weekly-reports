# Week 47 of 2023

## What did you plan to accomplish this week?

I planned to get Depot working locally and to make a lot of progress on the OS project. I also wanted to make serious progress on the architecture project.

## What did you accomplish this week?

I met with David and requested a referral for an internship position on his team at Esri. He seemed enthusiastic to have me back, so I completed an application and sent David a follow-up email. He wants me to work on porting a cloud application from .NET to Node.js, which seems interesting. More than anything else, I want a guaranteed internship for the summer.

I also worked on the mkfs functionality for the file system project. I did what I could and then handed it over to Ryan and Shiv, who made some changes to what I wrote.

## What problems/issues arose, and how did you attempt to resolve them?

I need some help making progress on the file system project because it's hard for me to figure out what a given function is supposed to do. I'm also struggling with reading other people's code and figuring out how to integrate it with my own. I need to revisit the file system lecture notes that Rich provided to get a conceptual idea of what we're building. As for reading my teammates' code, I need to consult with the reference documentation line-by-line.

I only had a little time to work on Depot, but I'm still stuck with setting up a JDK locally for Scala to run on top of. This issue seems like such a silly thing to be stuck on. I need to struggle with it for a little longer.

## What is your plan for next week?

My plan for this upcoming week is to devote myself to the file system project and ensure we have something working next Monday for our presentation. We are meeting on Wednesday at Ryan's place to work on it together, but I also want to make some decent progress before then.

I won't have much time to work on Depot this week, but I can contact the system administrators for my Eucalyptus credentials. I also need to figure out my local Java situation before I can make any progress.

I'm not sure how much time I'll have this week to work on the branch predictor evaluation framework, and Bhavye will also be pretty busy. I'll consider that project on hold until after the OS presentation on Monday.

## How does this fit into your long-term plan?
