# Week 44 of 2023

## What did you plan to accomplish this week?

I planned to finish the CS254 homework and phase 1 of the CS270 project. I also wanted to implement lab 3 for CS190B so that I could better answer students' questions.

## What did you accomplish this week?

I got the CS254 homework done, but it was rushed and incomplete. I do not know how to translate SystemVerilog code into a block-level diagram, so I just copied my pipeline diagram and added some components. My group submitted phase 1 of the OS project on time, but one group member did all of it. For phase 2, though, we'll need to collaborate because it is much more involved than phase 1. I need to set a task for myself to go through Ryan's code for phase 1 and make sure that I can understand it and run it. I also set up the development environment for lab 3 to explain it to other students because it is a bit more complex than lab 2. I also met with Bhavye today to discuss our to-dos for this week for the CS254 final project. This week, we proposed an idea for our final project to build a branch predictor evaluation framework. I think Jon approved of the concept, though the email he sent back was a bit cryptic.

## What problems/issues arose, and how did you attempt to resolve them?

One big issue that I ran into was with the CS254 homework. I feel that I don't have the necessary background information for that class, especially when it comes to block-level diagrams and reading/writing SystemVerilog. I also don't like how Jon takes a lot of background information for granted during in-class discussions because it makes me feel like I cannot add to class discussions. For the final project, I must dedicate time to learning SystemVerilog. I also couldn't get Ryan's code for phase 1 to work on my machine because he used the AWS command-line tools, which I haven't set up fully. I guess I could just cheese it and use the online console, but it would be best if we all used the same workflow. Another big issue that I've been facing is that it takes me so much damn time to read these dense technical papers for class, and I often just don't have the time to read them front-to-back in an in-depth manner. One thing I've been doing is copying down paragraphs at a time just to force myself to read each one thoroughly because I feel like skimming these papers doesn't give me any good insight. However, this takes a LOT of time. I either need to figure out a good in-between solution to reading these papers well, or I just need to dedicate much more time to reading. Both Rich and one of my other classmates advocate reading these papers front-to-back instead of jumping around, so I've been trying that.

## What is your plan for next week?

My highest-priority task is to finish the blog post for computer architecture. It's due on Monday, and I haven't started it yet, so that's what I'll spend all weekend working on. Hopefully, it doesn't take too much time. I need an outstanding grade on this to cancel out the lousy grade I will probably receive for homework 1. I also need to finish implementing lab 3 to get an idea of what the components are and how they connect because, to be honest, I barely know what this lab is about. I also want to set up Verilog TestBench and cocotb on my laptop to work on the architecture project with Bhavye. I need to get this done by Thursday. We are meeting with Balkind on Thursday, so it would be nice to have something to show him during our meeting.

## How does this fit into your long-term plan?

Like I said in last week's report, by the end of this quarter, I will be a straight whiz when it comes to efficiently reading and digesting dense computer science papers. Although it probably takes multiple readings to get to the level of knowledge that Rich has. That's sort of the neat thing about an excellent paper. You can read it multiple times and take something new away from it every single time. This class is also getting me interested in systems research, which I may want to pursue in the future. I want to take Chandra's course on runtime systems next quarter as well, but this systems research stuff has got me excited.
