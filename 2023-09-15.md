# Week 37 of 2023

## What did you plan to accomplish this week?

I wanted to settle into Santa Barbara and prepare to TA CMPSC 190B for the first time!

## What did you accomplish this week?

I read most of the LSCRDT paper and tried Chandra's new Docker setup instructions for Debian Bullseye. I also signed up for a CoE account to SSH into CSIL machines. I still need to finish labs 2 and 3.

## What problems/issues arose, and how did you attempt to resolve them?

I am still waiting to receive an official TA offer letter. I should send an email inquiring about that. I couldn't SSH into CSIL machines to try out the new Docker setup, but I could once I signed up for a CoE account.

## What is your plan for next week?

I should spend next week reading more RACELab publications to have a good idea of what kind of research the lab does. I also need to get back to Chandra about NDVI datasets and OpenET stuff. It's a very open-ended project at this stage, so I'm not sure what I should be looking to do now.

## How does this fit into your long-term plan?

Reading RACELab publications will give me a good idea of what kind of research I want to be doing myself. I'm also looking forward to attending other people's project meetings to see the nuts and bolts of some research projects. This quarter will mainly be me getting my course requirements out of the way to focus on more important things later.
