# Week 46 of 2023

## What did you plan to accomplish this week?

## What did you accomplish this week?

I spoke with Rich and Chandra on Tuesday about Depot and am now leading that project! There are a lot of exciting research questions in Depot, particularly regarding how we can stream data in the context of lazily evaluated dependency trees. My first step for that project is to get what we have working right now.

## What problems/issues arose, and how did you attempt to resolve them?

I did not have much time to work on the file system project with my group, so I am behind on what they are doing. I want to contribute my part to this project.

I also realized that my method of copying down research papers could be faster and more efficient. I like how typing a research paper makes me focus on every sentence and slows me down enough to comprehend it thoroughly, but it is too time-consuming. Rich reads papers front-to-back multiple times, but I will segment his approach and reading paragraphs until I understand it. It's faster this way, but let's see if my comprehension suffers.

I am also running into an issue with lab 4 for CS190B. I set up my development environment on my local machine instead of CSIL, and now it's biting me in the ass. To be able to do lab 4, I'm going to need to complete the Docker setup from scratch on CSIL because the AWS command-line tool doesn't work in the Docker container on my Mac. This issue was the problem that Docker containers were supposed to fix.

## What is your plan for next week?

I want to get the existing Depot codebase working on my laptop. To do this, I'll need to get a Eucalyptus key from Rich/Chandra because my key for CS270 will not work after this quarter. I also want to read the Depot paper front-to-back one more time to have a clearer picture of where we are now.

I also need to start working on the CS270 final project ASAP. I would feel bad if I was the only one who didn't contribute to the file system. Luckily, we're still in the beginning stage and have much work to do.

I met with Bhavye on Thursday, and we made some excellent progress on the branch predictor framework, but we still have much to do. Jon's code is challenging because it works tightly with Ariane and Piton, but I plan to figure out the general logic and write a test bench to drive it.

## How does this fit into your long-term plan?

I'm excited to work on the Depot project, and I hope to make some good progress on it this year. I would like to get a workshop paper out of this so I can use Depot to get some fellowship funding next year. Getting up to speed on this project won't take too long.
