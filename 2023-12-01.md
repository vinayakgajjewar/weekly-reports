# Week 48 of 2023

## What did you plan to accomplish this week?

I planned to spend most of this week working on the file system project for Rich's class.

## What did you accomplish this week?

I reached out to Rich to ask about TAing for CS170 next quarter. According to Liu, TAing for that class involves debugging memory leaks in C code, but it should be an instructive experience. Liu also said that Rich picks his TAs based on students he knows, so I'm confident he'll select me.

I made some progress on the file system project and opened a pull request for my changes, but I am out of my depth. Ryan and Shiv are basically carrying the group, and I'm unable to contribute because I don't know what's happening. Our presentation is on Monday, so we need to have everything working by then.

## What problems/issues arose, and how did you attempt to resolve them?

I'm having difficulty contributing to the file system project because Ryan and Shiv are handling everything. I don't want them to do all the work, and I try to help where possible, but it's hard for me to contribute meaningfully. Taking CS170 at UCSB would have better equipped me for CS270, but I can do nothing about that now.

## What is your plan for next week?

After the file system presentation on Monday, I'll commit myself to working on the branch predictor framework with Bhavye. We have more time for that project, but still not much. I'm more confident about this project than the file system.

I haven't had the time to work on the Depot project. I still need to get my Eucalyptus credentials from the UCSB system administrators. Once I do that and install Java 14 on my laptop, I should be good to go. Why does Depot depend specifically on Java 14? It's a pain to install, but I'm scared to try any other version of Java because it might break something.

## How does this fit into your long-term plan?
