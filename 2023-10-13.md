# Week 41 of 2023

## What did you plan to accomplish this week?

I planned to meet with Enbo and Peiyuan to learn more about their research and get some ideas about potential research projects of my own.

## What did you accomplish this week?

I met with Enbo and his advisor and Rich and Chandra. His research on the pre-positioning of wildfire response crews in UCSB is exciting and something we can work on. I also got Eucalyptus working on my CSIL machine so that I can do the CS270 project. I got the email stuff figured out, but I still need help using LibFUSE.

## What problems/issues arose, and how did you attempt to resolve them?

I had some issues regarding Eucalyptus, but I could use the online console to start my instance instead of the AWS command-line tools. The problem was not being able to expose port 22 to SSH connections. There is so much that I need to learn about how all these technologies work together. It'll take me a while to figure it all out. I also needed help understanding how to get the LibFUSE example filesystem to work. I think I built the codebase correctly, but I don't know how the `mount` and `umount` commands factor into all of it.

## What is your plan for next week?

I want to thoroughly understand the basic LibFUSE examples to do phase 1 of the CS270 project. I also need to meet with Bhavye to discuss the CS254 final project, even though our professor, Dr. Balkind, has not mentioned it in class. I also need to worry about summer internships (blegh!) and do the exercises in chapter 2 of the Writing Science book with Liu and Animesh. Another task I need to do is go through lab 2 in its entirety because my students will be starting lab 2 soon, and I want to be able to answer their questions about it with some familiarity. This week will be busy for me.

## How does this fit into your long-term plan?

Doing the exercises from Writing Science will help me become a better communicator, which will pay dividends when I start writing papers of my own. I'm excited to improve my writing skills because that is part of what pushed me to pursue a Ph.D. in the first place. I have much to learn about being a good TA.
