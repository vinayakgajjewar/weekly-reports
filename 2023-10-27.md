# Week 43 of 2023

## What did you plan to accomplish this week?

I planned to review lab 2 for CS190B to answer students' questions better. I also wanted to make progress on phase 1 of the file system project for CS270.

## What did you accomplish this week?

I didn't have the time to get to doing lab 2 again for CS190B, but I was able to make some progress on the CS270 project. The only thing I need to do now is to implement the email-sending functionality into the callbacks I wrote for my simple file system. It may be more complex than that, but we'll see. I also made some progress analyzing the AnyCore adaptive superscalar core for CS254. I found an excellent paper and poster presentation about AnyCore with a nice datapath diagram. I am also meeting with Bhavye today to discuss potential ideas for the CS254 final project.

## What problems/issues arose, and how did you attempt to resolve them?

I've encountered issues setting up the loaner Raspberry Pi devices for CS190B students. Usually, the direct connection works without a hitch, but I still encounter problems regarding the jump host connection. I'm doing something wrong somewhere. However, this is a good learning experience because, after this, I'll have a lot more experience working with and debugging Raspberry Pis.

## What is your plan for next week?

I need to finish homework one for CS254 this weekend, which involves writing a description of the AnyCore processor and coming up with some diagrams that detail its various components. I can get that done by Monday, though. I also want to get a head start on implementing labs 2 and 3 so I can better answer students' questions. I also want to finish off the LibFUSE email file system this weekend so we can move on to implementing the more complex functionality, which will likely take us much more time.

## How does this fit into your long-term plan?

I'm learning a lot this quarter about how to read technical papers and take something away from them. Hopefully, by the end of this quarter, I'll be an expert in reading systems papers.
