# Week 40 of 2023

## What did you plan to accomplish this week?

I planned to make some progress on the OpenET project this week while I continued with TAing and classes.

## What did you accomplish this week?

That's a good question. I thought about what area of research I wanted to work in. I still need to decide, but wireless sensor networks interest me. I found an introductory paper that I can read to gain insight into the field. I also started reading the book "Writing Science," which is all about writing as an academic. It's pretty cool!

## What problems/issues arose, and how did you attempt to resolve them?

I had to deal with a disruptive student during my section on Thursday. He was derailing the conversation and showing off how smart he was. This situation is a learning opportunity, though, because now I can learn some strategies to deal with these disruptions in the future. I've also been having some trouble with reading/understanding papers quickly, but Rich told me a good strategy for understanding any given text:
You read each word front-to-back.
You reread it, but highlight the topic sentence of each paragraph.
Read just the sentences you highlighted and see how the big picture comes together.

## What is your plan for next week?

My plan for next week is to continue reading the papers I keep downloading while I continue with classes and TAing. My classes seem time-intensive, so we'll see how much progress I can make. I also want to reach out to Peiyuan and meet to learn more about his current research before he leaves the RACELab. Next week, I also meet with a student and a professor interested in GIS research. I also need to continue reading Writing Science and do the exercises at the end of chapter 2. Also, I should look into finding an internship for the summer because Rich and Chandra want me to get that out of the way as soon as possible so that I can dedicate future summers to cranking out some research papers.

## How does this fit into your long-term plan?

Meeting with Peiyuan and Enbo will let me hear about other people's research while giving me an idea of what projects I can pursue. Also, getting an internship this summer would be good so that I can spend other summers doing research projects.
