# Week 45 of 2023

## What did you plan to accomplish this week?

## What did you accomplish this week?

I signed up for my classes next quarter. I'm taking Runtime Systems with Chandra, and I'm also taking Advanced Program Analysis. Many of my friends will also be taking these classes, which I'm happy about because it means I'll know some people in my classes. I also signed up to TA next quarter. It would be cool if I could TA the undergraduate versions of the grad classes I'm taking right now, but I signed up for a few others just in case those classes aren't available.

## What problems/issues arose, and how did you attempt to resolve them?

One issue I'm running into right now is that it is taking me too long to read the papers I need for class. The method I'm using right now to read these deeply technical papers is to type out each paragraph and then convert it to bullet-point notes, which takes a lot of time. One thing I could try is to type out the entire paper (or at least the important parts) all in one go and then turn that into bullet points because I feel like making multiple passes over a paper after you've read the whole thing front to back is good for understanding.

## What is your plan for next week?

I need to write the mkfs utility for our file system and some tests for the layer 0 abstraction. The tests should be simple because we're introducing the idea of logical block numbers. The mkfs program will be more involved. I also need to meet with Rich and Chandra on Tuesday to discuss the project further. I also need to keep plugging away at the computer architecture project because we must make consistent weekly progress to show Jon. Last weekend, we set up our Verilog development environment, and Jon also sent us some example branch predictors we can use. I don't know why we refer to our professors by their first names when we start graduate school. It still feels weird to me.

## How does this fit into your long-term plan?

Working on the Depot project will give me an excellent first taste of what conducting research at the graduate level is like. I am still not 100% sure if I want to work in big data/cloud computing, but it will still be a good experience.
