# Week 39 of 2023

## What did you plan to accomplish this week?

I planned to finish all the TA training and orientations I had lined up. I also wanted to finish reading that RACELab paper on version trees.

## What did you accomplish this week?

I finished the TA training as planned and had my very first TA section on Thursday! I helped test the Raspberry Pi for CS190B and developed an idea for the OpenET project. I want to work on cropland classification problems using a binary classifier. I followed an online tutorial using Google Earth Engine. Now, I want to see if it's possible to do something similar and train a model on data from the Santa Barbara area.

## What problems/issues arose, and how did you attempt to resolve them?

Chandra recommended that I meet with Peiyuan, a visiting postdoc from Oslo, to discuss his research while he's still in Santa Barbara. I tried reading some of his recent publications, but I need clarification. I get the general sense that he is doing something with wireless sensor networks, but I don't have the necessary background to comprehend his research yet. I'll ask Chandra for some background info or a reading list. I also tried SSH'ing into a Raspberry Pi wirelessly via the RACELab jump server, but I kept getting denied access (connecting via Ethernet worked flawlessly). I was worried that I broke something, but it turns out that the problem wasn't on my end but with the jump server itself!

## What is your plan for next week?

My classes will start next week, so I'll probably be very busy with that, but I still want to take some time to work on this project Chandra gave me. I need to schedule a meeting with her to pitch my ideas and see if I'm on the right track. I don't know how groundbreaking this sort of research is, but the way I see it, this is a warm-up project to familiarize me with the methodologies and procedures that I'll use later on with my research. I must also do labs 2, 3, and 4 for CS190B because I have severely put that off.

## How does this fit into your long-term plan?

I want to make something good out of the OpenET project because that will give me some training on how to do more complicated projects later in my Ph.D. and formulate research questions and whatnot. I don't have to do much this quarter because I will dedicate most of my time to TAing and classes, but I want to get as much as possible.
