# Week 42 of 2023

## What did you plan to accomplish this week?

I planned to understand the LibFUSE example code from the GitHub repository and meet with Bhavye to discuss the CS254 project. I also planned to look into some summer internships and do the Writing Science exercises. I couldn't get many things done this week because I fell sick on Tuesday/Wednesday and needed to rest. I need to make up for it during the upcoming week.

## What did you accomplish this week?

I couldn't get a lot done this week because I fell sick with the flu. I made some progress on phase 1 of the CS270 project; namely, I found a blog post explaining all the functions I need to implement. I also read some papers for CS270 and CS254 in preparation for next week. I didn't attend class this week, so I probably have some catching up to do with the material. I also graded half of the submissions for lab 1 of CS190B.

## What problems/issues arose, and how did you attempt to resolve them?

I had difficulty figuring out precisely what the example LibFUSE code did, so I found a blog post online explaining what each function does in depth. I still need to read it and understand it. CS190B is also a bit of a clusterfuck right now. I want to go through lab 2 in its entirety so that I know exactly how to answer the questions that students have for me. I can access the lab 2 solutions repository, so it should be quick. I need to do the same for labs 3 and 4 as well.

## What is your plan for next week?

I need to go through lab 2 for CS190B to answer other students' questions confidently. I also need to complete phase 1 of the CS190B project. I don't know when it's due, but sooner is better than later. I'm sure phase 2 is much more challenging, so giving myself and my group as much time as possible for that is a good idea. I also need to think of a good intro project to get my feet wet with research. I know Rich and Chandra don't expect much from me in my first quarter, but I can't help feeling that I should be proactive in learning how to do research. According to Rich, an excellent way to start is to recreate the results of a previously published paper to get a feel for how you can build off of it. I also have a potential collaboration with Enbo, but I wonder if a collaboration is a good idea for a first project. I also have that OpenET thing I could build off of. I don't know what open problems there are in that field. I could start with just recreating an existing paper's results. Perhaps I need to meet with Rich and Chandra to discuss my concerns.

## How does this fit into your long-term plan?

Getting some experience with a research project will teach me the skills and techniques I'll need later on down the line. I remember Animesh saying he worked on three research projects during his first year! That's overkill, but I should be doing something during my first year.
