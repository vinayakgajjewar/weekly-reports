# Week 38 of 2023

## What did you plan to accomplish this week?

I planned to read some more RACELab publications and make some progress on the OpenET project this week.

## What did you accomplish this week?

I started reading the paper on version trees for CRDTs, but I have yet to fully understand it. I also decided on my office hours times for CS190B and completed my TA training modules.

## What problems/issues arose, and how did you attempt to resolve them?

I could only progress a little on the version tree paper because I needed help understanding it. I should revisit the fundamentals and then get back to it.

## What is your plan for next week?

Next week, I will be busy with grad student orientation and TA training mostly. I will also squeeze in that RACELab paper I started reading.

## How does this fit into your long-term plan?

The TA training will prepare me well to successfully TA CS190B for the first time. Additionally, reading RACELab papers will give me an idea of what kind of research I can expect to perform as a grad student.
